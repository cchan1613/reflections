How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  staging area is the git structure that allows one to group a set of related files together for a single commit command from the working directory, while unrelated files still stay inside the working directory. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  use git add to all the updated files to the staging area first 
  use git diff --staged to check the changes between the staging area and repo
  use gif diff to check the remaning changes bewteen staging area and work dir

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

 branch allows the labeling temporary changes to the master into a different branch, once the branch is created using labeling, changes can be commit to it without affecting the master.

 commands are git branch to view what branch am I in
              git branch <label> to create a separate branch
              git checkout <label> to switch from current branch (master) to the                  <label> branch.
 once switched to a non-master branch, run git branch will show the current
 branch you are on, there is an asterisk added to the active branch name.
