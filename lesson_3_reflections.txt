When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It is because the file can be shared by others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    While you are working on a change, the branch has pulled the remote 
    automatically without your knowledge, chances are the file may constantly
    go out of sync, and risk overwriting your changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of a specific repository which were cloned within the remote GitHub server.
    Clones are duplicates of repository from github downloaded onto my local computer via a .git url.,
    Branchs are sequences of local commits splitted from a common parent node identified by different labels.


    When I find a public repository that I want to extend features for my own purpose but may not be 
    applicable to the original author, I will use the 'Fork' command on github dashboard to clone it 
    from the original author's account onto mine.

    When I want to add changes to a repository, I will use 'clone' to download the repository onto my local computer, 
    and work on the local repository so that my changes will not affect others.

    When I experiment with different ideas between adding new features and fixing bugs on my local computer,
    I will use branches to isolate them.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
